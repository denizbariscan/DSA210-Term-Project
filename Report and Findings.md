#FINDINGS

The project was initiated by collecting the necessary documents and data from both branches. Total sales quantities and revenues between October 2024 and April 2025 were obtained from each branch. In addition, monthly revenue data and the price ranges of each branch were also provided separately.

Once the data collection was completed, data cleaning and preprocessing were carried out, as detailly shown in the 'data processing' file.

Following the preprocessing phase, data analysis and visualization were performed.

Here are the throughout analysis of the obtained figures:

#Top 15 Products by Revenue - Hilltown vs. Balçova

At the Hilltown branch, the Ohannes Cheese Burger and Regular Cheese Burger emerge as the clear revenue leaders, significantly surpassing other items.

Balçova Branch:
Balçova’s revenue leaders differ notably; Bilader Menü is the top product, followed closely by Smash and Cheese burgers. The presence of menus (Bilader, Ulti) among the top products shows an inclination toward bundled offerings, reflecting a different consumer preference and possibly a younger, student-oriented customer base.

Comparative Analysis:
Hilltown emphasizes premium individual items, while Balçova prefers bundles and diverse offerings. This suggests distinct customer profiles at each location, with Hilltown appealing to individual customers with disposable income and Balçova targeting student groups.
