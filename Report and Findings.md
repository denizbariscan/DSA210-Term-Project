**FINDINGS**

The project was initiated by collecting the necessary documents and data from both branches. Total sales quantities and revenues between October 2024 and April 2025 were obtained from each branch. In addition, monthly revenue data and the price ranges of each branch were also provided separately.

Once the data collection was completed, data cleaning and preprocessing were carried out, as detailly shown in the 'data processing' file.

Following the preprocessing phase, data analysis and visualization were performed.

Here are the throughout analysis of the obtained figures:

**Top 15 Products by Revenue - Hilltown vs. Balçova**

Hilltown Branch:
At the Hilltown branch, the Ohannes Cheese Burger and Regular Cheese Burger emerge as the clear revenue leaders, significantly surpassing other items. Other popular items include various burger types (Tandır, Mushroom, Classic, Smash) along with beverages like Coca-Cola and Carlsberg beer. Considering tandır, bifteks and smash burger are items that contain more meat, along with the general domination of meat based burgers and beers, assumption that customer base is leaned more towards premium menu items and are not underage can be made.

Balçova Branch:
Balçova’s revenue leaders differ notably; Bilader Menü is the top product, followed closely by Smash and Cheese burgers. The presence of menus (Bilader, Ulti) among the top products shows an inclination toward bundled offerings, and the existence of chicken burger types in the top 15, reflects a different consumer preference and possibly a younger, student-oriented customer base. This analysation can be confirmed by the location of Izmir Economics University, which is really close to the Balçova branch.
