# DSA210-Term-Project
Introduction:
I am a student from Sabancı University, and this is my DSA210 term project. My family manages two differently located branches of a burger shop in Izmir, one in a mall, the other close to a university and opened more recently. The aim is to compare the performance of these branches by analyzing data on the top-selling menu items, prices, number of customers, and the impact of competitor store openings. Additionally, I will assess whether a major trend shift occurs after a competitor's arrival and if the branch responds with campaigns.

Motivation:
Understanding the performance differences between these two branches will help identify key factors influencing sales and customer behavior. This project will analyze external factors such as competition among stores and promotions or campaigns, helping optimize business strategies. Pricing and marketing policies can be improved and efficiency can be enhanced to ensure growth by the findings.

Hypothesis:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference in profit margins and customer traffic between these two branches regarding price, marketing, and location differences.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Profit margins and customer traffic change significantly between these two branches due to differences in pricing, marketing efforts, and location factors.

Data Source:
Accounting records of both branches, which include sales reports, pricing differences, and customer numbers, will be the primary data source. 

Objectives:
Analyzing Data: Identify the correlations affecting the business performance by processing and evaluating sales, pricing, and customer data.

Visualizing Data: Use data visualization techniques to present the findings effectively, and compare key performance metrics between the branches.

Optimizing Marketing Strategies: Analyze past promotions and campaigns to develop data-driven suggestions to improve future marketing plans.

Methodology:
Data Collection: The data for this project will be collected from the branches' accounting records over a specific period. These records will provide insight into the number of purchases made for the most popular products and their price variations. Peak hours and days of customer numbers will be tracked and used to determine whether a specific campaign or competitor impact had a major effect.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The collected data will be adjusted to a specific timeline, inconsistencies or errors will be eliminated. Sales trends, pricing structures, and customer influx patterns will be structured for analysis.

Data Analysis Techniques: The impact of location, pricing and marketing on sales performances will be evaluated by using methods such as correlation analysis, trend analysis and comparative analysis.

Visualization Tools: Data visualization techniques will be used to illustrate trends and relationships in the data. Graphs, charts, and dashboards will be created using tools like Excel and Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Interpretation & Recommendations: The findings will be analyzed to draw conclusions on how business strategies can be optimized. Recommendations will be provided based on trends and statistical insights.

Expected Outcomes:
Outcomes expected from this project are providing comprehensive analysis of the differences in sales, customer behavior and pricing strategies between the branches to help determine potential improvements for the newer branch and find better campaigns that match each branch's customer base. Data-driven recommendations will be made and used to optimize business strategies and operations. Findings can be used to assist in introducing new promotions and menu options based on customer preferences and purchasing trends. The project will help pinpoint key factors affecting profitability, enabling informed decisions to increase efficiency.
